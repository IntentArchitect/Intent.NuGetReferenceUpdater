joel.turner@intentarchitect.com *password* "C:\Dev\Intent.Modules.NET\Modules\Intent.Modules.NET.isln" 

Optional 
--resume-id {Application Id}

## Tips Notes

If it breaks and you need to re-run check the console, find the AppId of what you where busy with and use it with the --resume-id to continue from where you where

Again if it breaks the console should give you a good idea of what project it was busy with and what it was doing.
